<p>THE IDEA<br>
Focusing on primary school students from the age of 6 to 14 who have a passion in technology
but have no means of accessing the tutorials or means to learn the subjects by themselves, We
therefore took the initiative of finding out from the students and parents how much they would
like to have the access of the subjects at their fingertips since they are very essential.
There is need for an education platform where students who have a passion for Robotics and
Entrepreneurship can log in a website and learn everything that they want about this two subjects
from the basics to elementary learning. An example is a student can learn Robotics by using local
apparatus to make robots like bottle tops and motors.</p>
