<p>WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE<br>
Education is one of the most important areas for Kenya with 7%of GDP and some 22% of Govt
expenditure commited to the sector. By providing a platform where children can think and
explore new ideas away from the school curriculum, besides it will also help them review and
add on what they have been learning in the hacker camps this being the case the children will be
more interested in such events and will always look foreward for the next.
For parents it will not be a waste of time or resources since they will be able to keep track and
the progress of their children in regards to Robotics and entrepreneurship.
   The application will provide a platform for children to learn Robotics and explore in new ideas
through entrepreneurship especially after having the privilege of attending the kid’s hacker
camps.Basing on the fact that many similar applications will mainly focus on the school curriculum,
ours will focus on making the children explore on new ideas, enhance their creativity and
eventually think innovatively.</p>

     <p>THE IDEA<br>
Focusing on primary school students from the age of 6 to 14 who have a passion in technology
but have no means of accessing the tutorials or means to learn the subjects by themselves, We
therefore took the initiative of finding out from the students and parents how much they would
like to have the access of the subjects at their fingertips since they are very essential.
There is need for an education platform where students who have a passion for Robotics and
Entrepreneurship can log in a website and learn everything that they want about this two subjects
from the basics to elementary learning. An example is a student can learn Robotics by using local
apparatus to make robots like bottle tops and motors.</p>
